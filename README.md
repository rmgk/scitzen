# What?

With Scitzen you can write documents in a lightweight markup language (think markdown) and generate blog-like websites (think Jekyll) or long-form PDF articles (think LaTeX).

Scitzen has its own markup language, which is a mixture of Markdown, Asciidoc(tor), and LaTeX. It takes the idea of flexible blocks from Asciidoc but removes variety of syntax.

# Why?

• Writing static-site-generators is easier than figuring out existing ones.
• Markdown is too limited. Extensions are tool specific.
• Markdown and Asciidoc have too many things I find hard to remember.
• LaTeX has too much ad-hoc styling.
• Writing my own tool, allows me to co-evolve my documents along with my tool.


# How?

• There should also be an action that builds a native image you can download.
• Example project: https://github.com/rmgk/dissertation-scitzen-example


# So, why is the README still written in Markdown?

This is actually a valid Scitzen document. We just call it .md to trick Github into rendering the headers.
